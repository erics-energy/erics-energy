- 👋 Hi, I’m @erics-energy, and this is my gas industry work profile.
- 👀 I’m interested in data as it relates to energy usage, carbon and methane emissions reduction as well as digital twins.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau, PowerBI and data science packages in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any studies of emissions tracking, enabling new utility business models (using gasses for renewable energy storage, networked ground-source heat pumps, renewable natural gas or syngas) or process improvement.
